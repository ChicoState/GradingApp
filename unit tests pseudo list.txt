This is just a list of unit tests we need to code when we get there:

 make sure empty input isn't entered.
 make sure alphabetical input(not numerical), is entered in course name or any other name, inputs.
 make sure numerical input(not alphabetical) is entered in grade points input
 make sure valid number(no -20 in a assignment with 0-100 point range) is entered in grade points input
